## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I tried to reflect inputs values to cards at the same time and i used keyup event listener for this but im sure there are better ways to do this. I will continue to search for it.


```js
nameInput.addEventListener('keyup',function(){
})
```


### Continued development

This challange was little, fun project to do. I will continue to work on my css/responsive design skills and I will continue to learn JS fundamentals.
